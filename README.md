chrome plugin that encrypt web messages for secure messaging.

Text Encrypt/Decrypt Chrome Extension
This Chrome extension lets you encrypt and decrypt selected text on any webpage using AES-256-CBC encryption with a shared secret keyword. It's simple, secure, and works without popups.
Features

Encrypt Text: Select text, right-click, and choose "Encrypt Selected Text" to turn it into a secure format (SALT.IV.CIPHERTEXT, e.g., IxVI4E95z4QhFGl49dN0tg==.M9ASbX0HGD+nHJ5fPimtRA==.h+5Kc5LkWTvXBAn5aks4Lg==).
Decrypt Text: Select encrypted text, right-click, and choose "Decrypt Selected Text" to restore the original text.
Change Key: Right-click anywhere and select "Change Encryption Key" to set a new keyword.
No Popups: Uses a browser prompt to set the keyword once, saved for future use.
Notifications: Shows Chrome notifications (e.g., "Encryption successful!") instead of alerts.
Text Replacement: Replaces the selected text directly, even on sites like WhatsApp Web.

How It Works

Set Keyword: The first time you encrypt/decrypt, a prompt asks for a keyword. It's saved securely and reused.
Encrypt/Decrypt: Select text, use the context menu to encrypt or decrypt, and the text is replaced instantly.
Change Key: Update the keyword anytime via the context menu.
Notifications confirm success or show errors (e.g., "No text selected!" or "Invalid format!").

Installation

Clone or download this repository.
Open Chrome, go to chrome://extensions/, and enable "Developer Mode."
Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder.
Ensure crypto-js.min.js and icon files (icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png) are in the folder.

Usage

Encrypt: Select text (e.g., "Hello, world!"), right-click, choose "Encrypt Selected Text." The text becomes encrypted (e.g., SALT.IV.CIPHERTEXT).
Decrypt: Select encrypted text, right-click, choose "Decrypt Selected Text" to get the original text back.
Change Key: Right-click, select "Change Encryption Key," and enter a new keyword in the prompt.
Works in text fields (e.g., forms) and on static pages, including WhatsApp Web.

Notes

Security: The keyword is stored in Chromeâ€™s storage. To clear it, use chrome.storage.sync.remove('encryptionKey') in the console or change it via the menu.
Compatibility: Tested on Chrome 66+ with HTTPS sites. Works on WhatsApp Web and most webpages.
Dependencies: Requires crypto-js.min.js for encryption (included).
